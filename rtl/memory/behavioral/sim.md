# Simulation models

Since simulations models from Altera / Intel aren't open-sourced, they won't be commited into the github repo.
For a working simulation, you'll need them anyway, just copy them from their directory into this one.

## Where to find them ?

Typically, theses files come with Modelsim / Quartus installation, mine where :

C:\intelFPGA\18.1\\...\\altera_mf.v

Copy this file into this folder, and everything shall be fine !
Verilator is configured to ignore warnings from these file.

## I don't have theses files ?

Then, you can install the tools. You don't need a full license to get them, the free license (which I use)
is more than enough !

Install the tools here :
