# Tests

Theses tests are small assembly (and, at the end, C) programs, done to tests the core in it's operationnal states.
There's a script used to generate the memory, simulate the code, and read-back the memory states. This allow for automated tests.

| Test nr : | Description                                                                    | Status |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| test 1    | A very small program, just to ensure toolchain is working                      |        |
| test 2    | A small fibbonacci calculation program (use loops to get to the max value).    |        |
| test 3    | A program that exploit the CSR registers instructions for basics tests.        |        |
| test 4    | A program that execute some jumps depending on differents conditions.          |        |
| test 5    | A program that place the core into an exception or irq handling, and tries it. |        |
