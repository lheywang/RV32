# Simulation models

Since simulations models from Altera / Intel aren't open-sourced, they won't be commited into the github repo.
For a working simulation, you'll need them anyway, just copy them from their directory into this one.

## Where to find them ?
Typically, theses files come with Modelsim / Quartus installation, mine where :

C:\intelFPGA\18.1\modelsim_ase\altera\vhdl\src\altera_mf\altera_mf.vhd

## I don't have theses files ?
Then, you can install the tools. You don't need a full license to get them, the free license (which I use)
is more than enough !

Install the tools here :
